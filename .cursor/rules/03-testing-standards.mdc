# Testing Standards


## Testing Best Practices
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Follow the "Arrange-Act-Assert" pattern
- Test component behavior, not implementation
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Use meaningful test data

## Test Types
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components and functions
   - Focus on isolated behavior
   - Use mocks for dependencies

## Testing Utilities
- Use consistent testing utilities
- Create reusable test helpers
- Maintain a shared test setup
- Use proper cleanup after tests
