# Database Operations Guide

## Prisma Schema Structure
The main database schema is defined in [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) with the following key models:

- **Book**: Main book entity with source (ROYAL_ROAD | AMAZON)
- **BookContributor**: Links books to contributors with contributor types
- **Contributor**: Author/contributor information
- **BookReview**: User reviews for books
- **BookStats**: Statistical data for books
- **User**: User accounts and authentication

## Database Population Scripts
Scripts for populating the database are located in the `scripts/` directory:

- Use [scripts/populate-affiliate-links.ts](mdc:scripts/populate-affiliate-links.ts) as a reference for creating new population scripts
- Always use `prisma.book.upsert()` to avoid duplicates
- Handle multiple data formats with helper functions (see `getContributors()` and `getSourceUrl()`)
- Use proper error handling and logging
- Always disconnect Prisma at the end: `await prisma.$disconnect()`

## Database Query Patterns
When querying books with related data:

```typescript
// Include contributors and reviews
const books = await prisma.book.findMany({
  where: { source: 'AMAZON' },
  include: {
    bookContributors: {
      include: {
        contributor: true
      }
    },
    bookReviews: {
      where: { userId: 'specific-user-id' },
      take: 1
    }
  }
})
```

## Running Population Scripts
Execute with: `npx tsx scripts/script-name.ts`
