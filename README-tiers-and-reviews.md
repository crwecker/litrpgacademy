# Book Tier System and Reviews Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the book tier ranking system and review functionality for LitRPG Academy.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Book Tier System
Users can organize their read books into tiered rankings:

- **SSS Tier**: Current absolute favorite book (1 book maximum)
- **SS Tier**: Top-tier favorites (3 books maximum)  
- **S Tier**: Excellent books highly recommended (5 books maximum)
- **A, B, C, D, E, F Tiers**: Additional organization levels (unlimited books)

#### Database Schema
- `BookTier` model stores user tier assignments
- Unique constraint on `userId` + `bookId` (one tier per user per book)
- Enum `TierLevel` defines all tier options

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /user-api/tiers` - Assign book to tier
- `PUT /user-api/tiers/:id` - Update tier assignment
- `DELETE /user-api/tiers/:id` - Remove from tiers
- `GET /user-api/users/:userId/tiers` - Get user's tiers

### 2. Book Review System
Users can write text reviews for any book:

- One review per user per book
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Reviews include creation and modification timestamps

#### Database Schema
- `BookReview` model stores review text and metadata
- Unique constraint on `userId` + `bookId` (one review per user per book)
- Links to both User and Book models

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /user-api/reviews` - Create book review
- `PUT /user-api/reviews/:id` - Update existing review
- `DELETE /user-api/reviews/:id` - Delete review
- `GET /user-api/users/:userId/reviews` - Get user's reviews
- `GET /api/books/:bookId/reviews` - Get public reviews for a book

### 3. User Interface Components

#### TierList Component (`/my-tiers`)
- Displays all user's book tiers organized by level
- Shows tier limits and current book counts
- Remove books from tiers functionality
- Visual tier indicators with color coding

#### BookReviews Component (`/my-reviews`)
- Lists all user's book reviews
- Inline editing capabilities
- Review management (edit/delete)
- Book information display alongside reviews

#### BookActions Component
- Embeddable component for book pages
- Tier assignment dropdown with limit validation
- Review creation form
- Shows current tier/review status

### 4. Navigation Integration
- Added "My Tiers" and "My Reviews" links to authenticated user navigation
- Routes automatically generated using TanStack Router

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication
- All user-specific endpoints require JWT authentication
- Token passed via Authorization header
- User context verified on each request

### Data Validation
- Tier limits enforced at API level
- Input validation for review text
- Duplicate prevention via database constraints

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of tier limit violations
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states and optimistic updates

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly tier and review interfaces
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly interaction elements

## Usage Instructions
